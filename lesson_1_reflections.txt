Identifying changes in source code between versions is hard.
Doing it by computer is easier.

Dropbox, Google Docs & Wikipedia have version control.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pro: you can make commits at logical points when changes are implemented.
Cons; you can make too many or too few commits.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Committing multiple files makes sense to ensure that the state of the entire bunch of code is recorded at the time the programmer thought was a good time to save.

Committing single files save only the changes that were made. This saves space.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

log shows the times and notes for each commit.
diff shows the differences between commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

You can easily find the changes with commit.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
